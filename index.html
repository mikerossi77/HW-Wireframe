            The Clemson football program has ascended to heights never really reached before. The Tigers are among the
            elite of College Football. And by elite, we mean there’s Clemson, there’s Alabama
            and then there’s everybody else.
            In the ACC, though, it’s a bit more than just that.

            In conference, it’s Clemson, it’s Clemson’s backups, then it’s everybody else. A couple of years ago, the
            ACC was actually competing to be the best conference in the nation. There was a time where the Atlantic
            Division had four legitimate top-15 teams in Clemson, FSU, Louisville and NC State. The coastal had a couple
            of solid programs, as well.

                Virginia Tech is coming off the worst season in almost three decades, a 6-7 record that marked the first
                losing season since 1992. In an effort to put the 2018 season in the rearview mirror, Justin Fuente will
                have to turn to several experienced players to be leaders on and off the field. With only six
                scholarship seniors, Virginia Tech’s pool of experience isn’t as deep as other programs, but these ten
                players will be called upon to help lead the Hokies back on the right track in the 2019 season.
